# Rust Machine Learning Engineering

[!rust-mle](assets/repo_rust_mle.webm)

## This repo is a snippets collection of Rust based model deployments.
  * Usually model training is done in python and exported as ONNX, so we can use it on the rust side.
  * Examples covers dockerize complete solutions, with python code alongside and inference testing (payload test).
  * Some examples cover Kubernetes deployment
